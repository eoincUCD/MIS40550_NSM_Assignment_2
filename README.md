## MIS40550 Network Software Modelling, Assignment 2


First upload on Friday night 21/4/17. Last main thing to include is the simulation of information flow but I think I can do that in a few hours tomorrow. Will spend Sunday putting the report together.

22/4/17: Simulation and plots complete. All initial results uploaded along with updated code.
Still to do - Report, upload data files somehow (900mb), clean up, annotate code, make graphs pretty.

23/04/17: Dataset can now be downloaded from here:

23/04/17: Report is finished and is stored in the documents folder. Recommend reading this before runnning any code.
